## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
3. Why do we create a branch?
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
7. What is a merge conflict?
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?

1. Git is an open source software used for programmers to write code together.
2. Git is on your local pc while Github is on the cloud so you can share your code
3. A brance is something you add when you want to create something outside of your main project
4. A pull request lets you show the chnages you've made to a repository
5. get switch -c <main>
6. git fetch retrieves data from a remote repository to your local repository but only the original file. git pull does that but brings the changes that were made to the original source also. git merge takes lines from diferent brances and merges into a single branch
7. merge conflicts are when two people change the same lines
8. To resolve a merge conflict you edit that file by using git checkout to undo changes made.
